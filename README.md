# Bean Sketches

Some sketches for the Bean that prove to be useful from time to time.

# Sketch Index

## `heartbeat_led`

Blink the LED every ~5 seconds. Probably not the best sketch to run on a coincell but is ok when powered over a USB cable w/ voltage regulator (which I highly recommend for development).

## `serial_loopback`

Read all incoming bytes from the serial port 1-by-1 and write them back over the serial port unadulterated.


## `neopixel`

Simple sketch that uses the Adafruit Neopixel library.
